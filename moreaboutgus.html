        <p>Gus' Story:</p>
        <p>He was born on October 17th, 2016 in the far away country of Budapest, Hungary. The name on his passport says, "Chris", but we thought that was odd for a dog. After much thought and consideration we decided to name him after the mouse, Gus Gus, in "Cinderella".</p>
        <p>He's about a year and half old and spends most of his time running around the backyard. He has a "cousin" named Winter whom he plays with almost 90% of the time he's awake.</p>
        <p>When we weren't looking he would also try to eat the sand at the dog park when he was a puppy. Odd, right?</p>
